# 240-MP Architecture

240-MP is a retro VCR-style media app built with **C++ Qt6 + QML**, targeting **Raspberry Pi 4** and **macOS**. and this is the reference for working on 240-MP's code (whether you're adding a new module or changing an existing one). 

If you just want to install or build the app, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) and [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md). 

If you want to contribute, please start with [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Philosophy

Think of 240-MP as a **browsing shell** that hands off to **purpose-built tools**.

- The app shell handles browsing, auth, and settings
- **Modules** are self-contained media integrations (Local Files, Plex, Ambient Mode, etc...) that the shell discovers and loads at startup.
- When a user picks something to play, the shell hands off to a dedicated fullscreen tool and resumes when that tool exits. For video, that tool is **mpv**, launched as a subprocess by `MpvController`. mpv is installed separately (`apt install mpv` / `brew install mpv`).  240-MP does not link against libmpv.

The guiding idea: **browse structured content, then hand off to the right tool for the job** rather than bundling everything into one binary.

```

There are three modules today: `local_files`, `plex`, and `ambient_mode`. `plex` is a helpful reference when building something new as it covers a more complex use case (connecting to a 3rd party API with auth)

## Anatomy of a Module

A module has up to three parts:

| Part | Location | Required? |
|---|---|---|
| `manifest.json` | `modules/<name>/manifest.json` | **Yes** — read by `AppCore` at startup |
| QML views | `modules/<name>/views/` (entry point `Root.qml`) | **Yes** |
| C++ backend | `src/modules/<name>/<Name>Backend.h/.cpp` | Optional |

`AppCore` scans `modules/*/manifest.json` at startup. A module that needs **no backend** (pure QML) requires **no C++ changes at all** — drop in the folder and it's discovered. A module that needs a backend adds one `registerModule(...)` call in `main.cpp` (see [AppCore](#appcore--the-app-shell)).

```
modules/<name>/
  manifest.json             # identity + settings
  assets/images/logo.svg    # logo for the module / single color `#ffffff` to enable color schemes to re-color
  views/
    Root.qml                # module router (entry point)
    Items.qml               # list view
    Detail.qml              # detail/leaf view
```

## manifest.json Reference

Loaded at startup by `AppCore` — the single source of truth for a module's identity and settings. No C++ changes are needed to add or modify settings.

```json
{
  "id": "com.240mp.<name>",
  "name": "<DISPLAY NAME>",
  "icon": "assets/images/logo.svg",
  "entry_point_qml": "views/Root.qml",
  "settings": [ ... ]
}
```

### Setting types

| `type` | Description | Extra fields |
|---|---|---|
| `toggle` | ON/OFF toggle | `default: "ON"` or `"OFF"` |
| `list_single` | Single-select list | `options_source`, `options_slot`, `apply_slot` |
| `multiselect_submenu` | Multi-select list via submenu | `options_source`, `options_slot` |
| `directory_browser` | Keyboard-navigable directory picker | `default` (path string, may be empty) |
| `action` | Button that calls a backend slot | `action_slot` |

Additional fields any setting may carry:

- `key` — the config key written under `modules.<id>.<key>` in `config.json`. Supports dot-notation.
- `label` — display text in Settings.
- `requires_auth` — if `true`, the setting is only shown when the module reports an authenticated state via `get_module_auth_state(moduleId)`. Used by Plex to hide server/user/library settings until sign-in.

### Dynamic options and apply slots

- For `list_single` / `multiselect_submenu` with `"options_source": "dynamic"`, the backend slot named by `options_slot` must emit `dynamicOptionsReady(key, [{id, label}])`. `AppCore` re-emits it to QML with the module ID prepended.
- For `list_single` with `apply_slot`, that slot is called automatically (routed through `invoke_module_action`) when the user changes the value.

A real example (Plex) — note `requires_auth`, dynamic options, and apply slots:

```json
{
  "key": "server_machine_id",
  "label": "Server",
  "type": "list_single",
  "options_source": "dynamic",
  "options_slot": "getServers",
  "apply_slot": "applyCurrentServerSetting",
  "requires_auth": true
}
```

## AppCore — the App Shell

`AppCore` (`src/AppCore.h/.cpp`) is the shell. It's exposed to all QML as the context property **`appCore`**.

**Global context properties** (available in all QML): `appCore`, `mpvController`, plus one per module backend (`localFilesBackend`, `plexBackend`, `ambientModeBackend`, …). Backend names are assigned by the `registerModule` call in `main.cpp`.

### Q_INVOKABLE slots used by QML

| Slot | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `scan_for_modules()` | Emits `modulesLoaded` with enabled modules |
| `get_settings()` | Returns entire `config.json` as a map |
| `get_setting(moduleId, key)` | Returns a single setting value |
| `save_setting(moduleId, key, value)` | Writes to `config.json`; supports dot-notation keys |
| `get_module_info(moduleId)` | Returns `{name, icon}` for a module |
| `get_module_settings_schema(moduleId)` | Returns the module's settings array |
| `invoke_module_action(moduleId, slotName)` | Routes to the registered backend via `QMetaObject::invokeMethod` |
| `get_module_auth_state(moduleId)` | Returns the module's auth state (for `requires_auth` settings) |
| `getCustomColorScheme()` | Returns the user's custom color scheme |
| `listDirectories(path)` / `parentDirectory(path)` / `homePath()` | Helpers for `directory_browser` |

### Signals

`modulesLoaded`, `appSettingChanged`, `moduleSettingChanged(moduleId, key, value)`, `dynamicOptionsReady(moduleId, key, options)`, `moduleAuthStateChanged(moduleId)`.

### registerModule — wiring a backend in

Backends are wired in from `main.cpp` with a single call:

```cpp
YourBackend yourBackend(appRoot, dataRoot);   // construct with whatever args the ctor needs

appCore.registerModule("com.240mp.<name>", "yourBackend", &yourBackend, ctx);
```

`registerModule(moduleId, contextProperty, backend, ctx)` does everything: it stores the backend for `invoke_module_action` routing, exposes it to QML under `contextProperty`, and connects the backend's optional signals/slots **by introspection** — each is wired only if the backend actually declares it, so there are no per-capability lambdas:

| Backend member (if declared) | Auto-connected to |
|---|---|
| signal `dynamicOptionsReady(QString, QVariant)` | re-emitted as `appCore.dynamicOptionsReady(moduleId, key, options)` |
| signal `authStateChanged()` | re-emitted as `appCore.moduleAuthStateChanged(moduleId)` |
| slot `onSettingChanged(QString, QString, QVariant)` | `appCore.moduleSettingChanged(moduleId, key, value)` |

The module ID lives in exactly one place per module — this call. Declare these members with the exact signatures above and `registerModule` wires them with no other changes to `main.cpp`.

## Playback Hand-off (MpvController)

The current MPV implementation is a good reference implementation of the "browse & hand-off" philosophy. When a module decides to play a video, it hands off to **mpv** rather than rendering video itself. All of that lives in `MpvController` (`src/player/MpvController.h/.cpp`), exposed to QML as the context property **`mpvController`**.

### How the hand-off works

1. **Launch** — `loadAndPlay(url, startSeconds, audioTrack, subTrack, ...)` starts mpv as a `QProcess`. Playback parameters are passed as mpv command-line flags: `--start=<sec>` (resume offset), `--playlist-start=<n>`, `--loop-playlist=inf`, and so on. mpv is found on `PATH` — the app never links libmpv.
2. **Control channel** — mpv is started with `--input-ipc-server=<socket>` (a Unix domain socket at `/tmp/240mp-mpv.sock`). `MpvController` connects to it with a `QLocalSocket` and sends JSON commands via `sendCommand(QJsonArray)`. `seekTo()` and `sendKey()` (which sends mpv a `keypress` command) go over this channel — that's how the USB remote / keyboard drives mpv's OSC while it's fullscreen.
3. **State back to QML** — `MpvController` issues `observe_property` for `time-pos`, `duration`, and `playlist-pos`, and re-publishes them as `Q_PROPERTY`s + the `positionChanged` / `durationChanged` / `playlistPosChanged` signals. A watchdog timer logs a warning if no `time-pos` event arrives for ~10 s (freeze detection).
4. **Exit** — when mpv quits, `MpvController` emits **`playbackFinished(finalPos, finalDur)`** on a normal exit (used to record resume position), or **`playbackFailed()`** when mpv exits with code 2 (file couldn't be played) — `Player.qml` listens for this to retry with transcoding.

### Custom OSC (Lua)

The on-screen controls mpv shows during playback are custom Lua scripts in `scripts/` (`mpv-osc.lua` for normal playback, `ambient-osc.lua` for Ambient Mode), loaded via mpv's `--script=` flag. Options are passed in with `--script-opts=` (e.g. `transcode-offset=<sec>`). The remote's key events reach these scripts through the `keypress` IPC bridge described above.

### Raspberry Pi headless hand-off (EGLFS)

On RPi Lite there because there is no display server; Qt draws via EGLFS straight to the KMS/DRM framebuffer, so the app and mpv can't both own the screen at once. `MpvController` performs a DRM/VT hand-off: it saves Qt's DRM CRTC state, switches to a free virtual terminal so mpv can take the framebuffer, and **restores** Qt's CRTC state when mpv exits (`saveDrmCrtcState` / `restoreDrmCrtcState`, `doHeadlessRestore`, plus the VT-switch helpers). This is Linux-only (`#ifdef Q_OS_LINUX`); on macOS the hand-off is a plain fullscreen window swap.

### Adding a different hand-off target

The longer-term vision is to hand off to *other* purpose-built tools (e.g. RetroArch), not just mpv. `MpvController` is the template for that: launch the external tool as a `QProcess`, drive it over whatever control channel it offers, surface progress/exit back to QML via signals, and (on RPi Lite) bracket the launch with the same DRM/VT save-and-restore so the framebuffer is handed over cleanly and returned on exit.

## Input (InputManager)

All input arrives in QML as **ordinary key events** — views bind `Keys.onPressed` / `Keys.onUpPressed` / etc. and never know which physical device produced the event. Keyboards and keyboard-emulating USB remotes deliver real key events natively; **USB game controllers** are translated by `InputManager` (`src/input/InputManager.h/.cpp`, exposed to QML as the context property **`inputManager`**).

**Please don't add gamepad-specific handling to a view** — if a view handles the right keyboard keys then with this setup it will also handle gamepads.

### How it works

1. **SDL2 GameController** — `SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_GAMECONTROLLER)` only (no video subsystem, so it works headless under EGLFS). A 16 ms `QTimer` on the main thread polls SDL events: hotplug (`CONTROLLERDEVICEADDED/REMOVED`), buttons, and axes. SDL's built-in controller database normalizes most pads to a standard layout, so defaults "should" work out of the box. The `SDL_HINT_JOYSTICK_ALLOW_BACKGROUND_EVENTS` hint keeps controller input flowing while mpv's window holds OS focus during playback.
2. **Buttons → actions → key events** — each SDL input maps to one of seven named actions below, and each action synthesizes one Qt key. Button identities are **positional** (using an Xbox reference layout — `SDL_HINT_GAMECONTROLLER_USE_BUTTON_LABELS` is forced off so Nintendo-type pads behave the same): `a` is always the south face button and input.cfg accepts `south`/`east`/`west`/`north` aliases to try to make it easier to wrap my head around =)

   | Action | Qt key | Default binding |
   |---|---|---|
   | `up` / `down` / `left` / `right` | arrows | D-pad, left stick, LB/RB (left/right) |
   | `select` | Return | A |
   | `back` | Escape/Backspace | B, Select |
   | `play_pause` | Space | Start |

3. **Delivery** — while the Qt window is **active**, synthesized `QKeyEvent`s are posted to the root QQuickWindow and reach the QML `activeFocusItem` like real key presses; on RPi/EGLFS the window is always active, so during playback they flow through the Player views' existing key forwarding (`mpvController.sendKey(...)`). When the window is **inactive** (like on MacOS where fullscreen mpv holds OS focus) and QQuickWindow has no `activeFocusItem`; `InputManager` instead emits `mpvKeyRequested(key)`, which `main.cpp` connects to `MpvController::sendKey`.  That will drive mpv directly over IPC with the same key names. The net result is that gamepads drive mpv identically to the keyboard on both platforms. Held directions auto-repeat (400 ms delay, 100 ms interval) so lists and ff/rw feel like keyboard repeat.
4. **User overrides** — `$DATA_ROOT/input.cfg` (`<input> <action>` per line, `#` comments, merged over defaults, live-reloaded via `QFileSystemWatcher`). An optional `$DATA_ROOT/gamecontrollerdb.txt` can add SDL mappings for exotic pads. Check out grammar and examples in [BUILDING.md → Gamepad input](BUILDING.md#gamepad-input-inputcfg).
5. **Adaptive footers** — `inputManager` exposes `lastInputDevice` (`"keyboard"` | `"gamepad"`, tracked via an app-wide event filter that ignores the synthesized events by their magic `nativeScanCode`) and a `hints` map (`back`, `select`, `navigate`, `change`, `browse`, `play_pause`). Main.qml mirrors it as **`root.hints`**, and footer hint labels bind to that — e.g. `root.hints.back + ":BACK"` renders `[ESC]:BACK` while the keyboard is active and `[B]:BACK` after a controller press, reflecting the live mapping. Views should bind to `root.hints.*` (similar to how we handle `root.sh`), **not** `inputManager.hints.*` because id-resolved `root.*` will stay valid when swappig views.  If you don't when the module Loader swaps views, the dying view's context properties will resolve to null and bindings on them will throw TypeErrors during teardown. Face-button labels are translated to what's printed on the **last-touched** controller via `SDL_GameControllerGetType` (Nintendo swaps A/B & X/Y; PlayStation shows X/O/SQ/TR), and `label <button> <text>` lines in input.cfg override them for pads that misreport their type. New views with footers should now use `root.hints.*`, and not hardcoded `[ESC]`/`[ENTER]` strings like I had in my previous implementation.

## C++ Backend Patterns

Backends are `QObject` subclasses registered via `registerModule(...)` before the engine loads.
Please review `PlexBackend` as a reference implementation.

- All HTTP via `QNetworkAccessManager` — async, on the main thread, no worker threads needed.
- Results returned to QML via signals.
- Auth/state persisted to JSON files in the data dir.
- `Q_INVOKABLE` for slots called from QML; `signals:` for callbacks to QML.
- For dynamic settings dropdowns, emit `dynamicOptionsReady(key, [{id, label}])` — auto-connected; `AppCore` re-emits with the module ID prepended.
- For auth-gated modules, emit `authStateChanged()` on sign-in/out — auto-connected and re-emitted as `moduleAuthStateChanged(moduleId)`.
- To react to your own settings changing, add a slot `onSettingChanged(moduleId, key, value)` — auto-connected to `moduleSettingChanged`.
- A backend resolves its own configured paths in its constructor — e.g. `LocalFilesBackend` / `AmbientModeBackend` read `media_directory` from `config.json` (defaulting to `dataRoot/media` / `dataRoot/ambient`). `main.cpp` does not touch module paths.

## QML View Patterns

### Root.qml — module router

Every module requires `Root.qml` as its entry point. It owns the internal nav stack and handles exiting back to the module list.

```qml
import QtQuick

FocusScope {
    id: moduleRoot

    signal goBack()

    property var navParams: ({})

    // must match your manifest id
    property var _moduleInfo: appCore ? appCore.get_module_info("com.240mp.<name>") : ({})
    property string moduleName: _moduleInfo.name || ""
    property string moduleIcon: _moduleInfo.icon || ""

    property var navStack: []
    property var currentParams: ({})

    function navigateTo(viewPath, params, fromState) {
        var resolved = Qt.resolvedUrl(viewPath)
        navStack.push({ source: internalLoader.source, params: currentParams, listState: fromState || {} })
        currentParams = params || {}
        internalLoader.setSource(resolved, { "navParams": params || {} })
    }

    function navigateBack() {
        if (navStack.length === 0) {
            moduleRoot.goBack()
            return
        }
        var prev = navStack.pop()
        if (!prev.source || prev.source.toString() === "") {
            moduleRoot.goBack()
            return
        }
        var restored = Object.assign({}, prev.params)
        restored.navListState = prev.listState || {}
        currentParams = restored
        internalLoader.setSource(prev.source, { "navParams": restored })
    }

    Loader {
        id: internalLoader
        anchors.fill: parent
        focus: true
        onLoaded: { if (item) item.forceActiveFocus() }

        Connections {
            target: internalLoader.item
            ignoreUnknownSignals: true
            function onNavigateTo(path, params, listState) { moduleRoot.navigateTo(path, params, listState) }
            function onGoBack() { moduleRoot.navigateBack() }
        }
    }

    Component.onCompleted: navigateTo("Items.qml", {})
}
```

**Rules:**
- `id` is always `moduleRoot`.
- `moduleName` / `moduleIcon` always come from `appCore.get_module_info(...)` — never hardcoded.
- `goBack()` is the only signal that leaves the module — child views never emit it directly.
- `navigateBack` merges `navListState` back into params on pop so list views can restore position.
- For auth flows that need `replaceWith` (navigate without pushing to the stack), please see the Plex module as a reference.

### Items.qml — list view

```qml
import QtQuick
import Components

FocusScope {
    id: itemsRoot

    property var navParams: ({})
    property var navListState: navParams.navListState || ({})

    signal navigateTo(string path, var params, var listState)
    signal goBack()

    focus: true
    Keys.onPressed: function(event) {
        if (event.key === Qt.Key_Escape || event.key === Qt.Key_Backspace) {
            goBack()
            event.accepted = true
        }
    }

    AppBar {
        anchors.top: parent.top
        anchors.left: parent.left
        anchors.topMargin: root.sh * 0.125
        anchors.leftMargin: root.sw * 0.125
        iconSource: moduleRoot.moduleIcon
        title: moduleRoot.moduleName
    }

    ListView {
        id: itemList
        anchors.topMargin: root.sh * 0.25
        anchors.leftMargin: root.sw * 0.115625

        // restore list position on back-navigate
        Component.onCompleted: {
            var restore = navListState.currentIndex !== undefined ? navListState.currentIndex : 0
            currentIndex = Math.min(restore, Math.max(0, count - 1))
            positionViewAtIndex(currentIndex, ListView.Contain)
        }

        Keys.onReturnPressed: {
            navigateTo("Detail.qml", { item: model[currentIndex] }, { currentIndex: currentIndex })
        }
    }
}
```

### Detail.qml — leaf view

```qml
import QtQuick
import Components

FocusScope {
    id: detailRoot

    property var navParams: ({})

    signal goBack()

    focus: true
    Keys.onPressed: function(event) {
        if (event.key === Qt.Key_Escape || event.key === Qt.Key_Backspace) {
            goBack()
            event.accepted = true
        }
    }

    AppBar {
        anchors.top: parent.top
        anchors.left: parent.left
        anchors.topMargin: root.sh * 0.125
        anchors.leftMargin: root.sw * 0.125
        iconSource: moduleRoot.moduleIcon
        title: moduleRoot.moduleName
        subtitle: navParams.item || ""
    }
}
```

**View rules:**
- Always declare `property var navParams: ({})` — the router passes params via `Loader.setSource`.
- List views also declare `property var navListState: navParams.navListState || ({})` and restore position in `Component.onCompleted`.
- `navigateTo` always takes 3 args: `(path, params, listState)` — pass `{ currentIndex: listView.currentIndex }` as listState when pushing to a detail view.
- Leaf views only need `signal goBack()` — no `navigateTo`.
- Use `root.sh` / `root.sw` for all margins and sizes — never hardcoded pixels. This keeps layouts responsive across CRT (240p/480i, watch overscan) and HDMI/LCD.
- Access shared state via `moduleRoot.moduleName`, `moduleRoot.moduleIcon`.
- Navigate via signals — never call router functions directly.

## Components (WIP)

Shared QML components live in `views/Components/` (registered via `qmldir`, imported as `import Components`).

### AppBar (`views/Components/AppBar.qml`)

| Property | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `iconSource` | `url` | Module icon — use `moduleRoot.moduleIcon` |
| `title` | `string` | Module name — use `moduleRoot.moduleName` |
| `subtitle` | `string` | Optional context label (hidden when empty) |

The icon is automatically colorized to the app accent color

## Config Storage

User configuration is stored in `config.json` in the app's data directory:

```json
{
  "app": { "color_scheme": "Video 1" },
  "modules": {
    "com.240mp.plex": { "enabled": true, "server_machine_id": "...", ... }
  }
}
```

Each module's settings live under `modules.<id>`. Use `save_setting` / `get_setting` (which support dot-notation keys) rather than writing the file directly. The data directory is created on first run and is separate from the app itself, so rebuilding never wipes user settings. For the exact per-OS path (macOS vs Raspberry Pi OS), see [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md#configuration).
